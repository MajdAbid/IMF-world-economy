# Conclusion

This exploration of global macroeconomic factors, focusing on regional disparities, G7-BRICS comparisons, and aggregate trends, reaffirms established intuitions about economic inequalities, revealing more predictable patterns in stable economies (e.g., Western Europe, North America) compared to volatile regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. A critical insight is the divergence between nominal GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), with the latter offering a more equitable lens for evaluating Global South economies. Key limitations include the absence of granular data on cross-country trade dynamics, resource distribution, and non-economic indicators like social welfare or inequality, which restrict a holistic assessment. 
The project also questions GDP’s dominance as a proxy for economic strength, underscoring its political limitations in capturing societal well-being. Future work should integrate trade networks, resource dependencies, and alternative metrics (e.g., Human Development Index) to contextualize growth narratives. Lessons emphasize the necessity of PPP-adjusted analyses to counterbalance nominal data biases and the urgency of redefining “economic strength” beyond GDP to address systemic inequities and policy shortcomings.
