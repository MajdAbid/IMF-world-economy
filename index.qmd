# Introduction

The study of global macroeconomic factors offers a lens through which to understand the complexities and disparities that define the modern economic landscape. This project delves into regional inequalities, contrasts between G7 and BRICS economies, and broader aggregate trends, aiming to shed light on the persistent and often widening gaps between stable and volatile regions. While established intuitions about economic inequalities are reaffirmed—such as the relative predictability of advanced economies in Western Europe and North America compared to the volatility of regions like Sub-Saharan Africa—this exploration also uncovers critical nuances. Among these is the divergence between nominal GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), with the latter emerging as a more equitable framework for evaluating the economic realities of Global South nations.
